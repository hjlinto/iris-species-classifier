# Iris Species Classifier (KNN)

This project is a complete AI/ML solution for classifying iris flowers based on their physical features. Built using the classic Iris dataset, the model applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, including full preprocessing, model training, evaluation, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.

---

## Features

- Loads and processes the Iris dataset
- Applies feature scaling and train-test splitting
- Trains a KNN classifier for species prediction
- Evaluates model performance using multiple metrics
- Applies cross-validation to assess generalization
- Optimizes model with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
